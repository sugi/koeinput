# Development notes

## Build

```sh
scripts/dev cargo build --release --workspace
```

`scripts/dev` runs cargo in a rootless podman container (Debian 13, Rust 1.95). The host has no `-dev` packages, and the container gives every developer the same toolchain and libraries.

## Test

```sh
scripts/dev cargo test --workspace
scripts/dev dbus-run-session -- cargo test -p koeinput-daemon --features test-hooks
scripts/dev cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

- Unit tests run with the first command.
- The daemon's D-Bus tests need a private session bus, so they run under `dbus-run-session`.
- Model tests are opt-in: set `KOEINPUT_MODEL_TESTS=1` and `KOEINPUT_TEST_MODELS_DIR=<dir with installed models>`.
- The microphone test is opt-in: set `KOEINPUT_AUDIO_TESTS=1`.

## Run the daemon in the dev container

The release binaries need `libpulse`, the session bus and the PulseAudio socket, so run them in the dev container, not in podman.

```sh
HOME=$PWD/work/home KOEINPUT_DATA_DIR=$PWD/data target/release/koeinput-daemon &
sleep 3
target/release/koeinput status
HOME=$PWD/work/home KOEINPUT_DATA_DIR=$PWD/data target/release/koeinput transcribe --partials <file.wav>...
kill %1
```

`status` should print `ready: yes` and `model: parakeet-ja`. `transcribe` runs the recognizer inside the CLI process, not through the daemon.

## Try dictation

With the daemon running, start `koeinput listen`:

1. Press Enter. It prints `[preparing]`, then `[recording]`.
2. Speak after `[recording]`. Partial text appears on the current line.
3. Press Enter to stop. The final text appears with the time it took after you stopped.

`q` + Enter quits. Ctrl-C cancels the current session and quits.

## Install a model

```sh
koeinput model install parakeet-ja
koeinput model install parakeet-ja --from-file <archive>
```

Use `--from-file` to install from an archive you already downloaded.

## Privacy

Recognized text is never written to logs unless you set `KOEINPUT_LOG_TEXT=1`.
